Small Plants
1. Water needed for 10 small plants: 2 liters/plant * 10 plants = 20 liters

Medium Plants
1. Water needed for 3 medium plants: 5 liters/plant * 3 plants = 15 liters
2. Since the number of medium plants (3) is odd, add 1 extra liter/plant: 1 liter/plant * 3 plants = 3 liters
3. Total water needed for medium plants: 15 liters + 3 liters = 18 liters

Large Plants
1. Water needed for 2 large plants: 10 liters/plant * 2 plants = 20 liters

Total Water Needed
1. Add the water needed for all plants: 20 liters (small) + 18 liters (medium) + 20 liters (large) = 58 liters
