        2) Vanilla flavoured cookies (You hate the most!, your friend likes it!) <br>
        3) Chocolate and Vanilla flavoured cookies (Both of you like it!) <br>
        4) Plain cookies (Both of you hate it!) <br>
        The baker is some emotional, That he will stop baking the cookies if one of you leaves the shop.
